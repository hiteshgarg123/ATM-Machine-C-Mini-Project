In this case , we'll suggest you to use Dev C++ IDE with GCC compiler to run the code , As it is very easy and simple to use.
However there is no boundation of use of IDE , You may use any IDE that you prefer.

## Some more information 

**Information about files**

**ATM Machine C Mini Project.c** : This is the main file where all the code and functionality of program is present.

**Reading driver.c** : This file is used to read the details present in "Account_Details.dat" file.

**Details Entry.c** : This file is for making new users/Account holders in "Account_Details.dat" file.

**temp.dat** : This is an empty dummy file , Basically you don't need to download it , This file will automatically get created ones you execute the main program ( ATM Machine C Mini Project.c) and will also get deleted after the program is ended .
Use of this file is to provide a two file system , that is used to store the details of modified account along with all other accounts and after that , it gets renamed to "Account_Details.dat"
Refer to code in main program for more information.

**Account_Details.dat** : This file contains records of all the account holders.
 
*The details in file are stored in binary form for more security.*
 
*Modifying binary files is slightly different than text files so handle them carefully.*
